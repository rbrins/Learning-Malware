# Learning Malware repo

This is a repo of incomplete notes on courses that related to the magics of malware. 
Note content is from:
- PMAT (TCM Academy)
- Python201 (TCM Academy)
- Sektor7 (Malware Beginners)
- Offesnive Nim (github repo)

The goal is the create a basic dropper (which executes shellcode from its code), that is encrypted, in exe or dll format, that can be injected into another process; in a few different languages: nim, c, and c# for Windows OSes.

## Compiling Nim

Since we are interested in Nim first, the command to compile is below (with lib being dll in a windows environment)
`nim compile --app:console|gui|lib|staticlib projectfile`
