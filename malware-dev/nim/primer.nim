# 1. Create an immutable variable containing your age (in years). Print your age in days. (1 year = 365 days).

const age_years: int = 28
const days_Per_Year: int = 365
var age_Days: int = days_Per_Year * age_Years
echo "I am ", age_Days, " days old"

# 2. check if your age is divisilbe by 3. 
# I wanted to use an if statement here, but also wanted to try it from a complete beginner seeing these exercises
var isNotDivsBy3: bool = bool(age_Years mod 3)
echo "My age is divisible by 3: ", not isNotDivsBy3

# 3. Create an immutable variable containing your height in centimeters. 
# Print your height in inches. (1 in = 2.54 cm)
const height_cm: int = 180
const cm_per_inch: float = 2.54
const inch_per_cm: float = 1/cm_per_inch
echo "My height in inches: ", float(height_cm) * inch_per_cm 

# 4. A pipe has a 3/8 inch diameter. Express the diameter in centimeters.
echo "A 3/8 inch pipe in diameter is ", ((3/8)*cm_per_inch)  ," cm"

# 5. Create an immutable variable containing your first name, 
# and another one containing your last name. 
# Make a variable fullName by concatenating the previous two variables. 
# Don’t forget to put a whitespace in-between. Print your full name.

const first_name = "Russell"
const last_name = "Brinson"
var full_name: string = first_name & ' ' & last_name
echo "My Name is: ", full_name

# 6. Alice earns $400 every 15 days. 
# Bob earns $3.14 per hour and works 8 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
# After 30 days, has Alice earned more than Bob? (Hint: use relational operators)

const alice_earns_per_15: float = 400
const bob_earns_per_hour: float = 3.14
const bob_hours_per_day: float = 8
const working_days: float = 30

var alice_30_day_earnings: float = alice_earns_per_15 * (working_days/15)
var bob_30_day_earnings: float = bob_earns_per_hour * bob_hours_per_day * working_days
echo "Alice has earned more than Bob in 30 days: ", alice_30_day_earnings > bob_30_day_earnings
echo "we con verify, alice earned: ", alice_30_day_earnings
echo "bob earned                 : ", bob_30_day_earnings



# 1. Collatz conjecture is a popular mathematical problem with simple rules. 
# First pick a number. If it is odd, multiply it by three and add one; if it is even, 
# divide it by two. Repeat this procedure until you arrive at one. 
# E.g. 5 → odd → 3*5 + 1 = 16 → even → 16 / 2 = 8 → even → 4 → 2 → 1 → end!
# 
# Pick an integer (as a mutable variable) and create a loop which will 
# print every step of the Collatz conjecture. (Hint: use div for division)
echo "Collatz Conjecture"
var pick_a_number: int = 5
echo "Starting num: ", pick_a_number

while pick_a_number != 1:
  # mod 2 returning 0 means it is even, but the bool() will have a 0, which would be false, 
  # we not() that to get true if even, false if odd
  # if even:
  if (not bool(pick_a_number mod 2)):
    pick_a_number = pick_a_number div 2
    echo "Even: num / 2 = ", pick_a_number 

  else:
    pick_a_number = pick_a_number * 3
    inc pick_a_number
    echo "Odd: (num * 3) + 1 = ", pick_a_number


# 2. Create an immutable variable containing your full name. 
# Write a for-loop which will iterate through that string and print only the vowels (a, e, i, o, u). 
# (Hint: use case statement with multiple values per branch)



# 3. Fizz buzz is a kids game sometimes used to test basic programming knowledge. We count numbers from one upwards. If a number is divisible by 3 replace it with fizz, if it is divisible by 5 replace it with buzz, and if a number is divisible by 15 (both 3 and 5) replace it with fizzbuzz. First few rounds would look like this: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, …​
# Create a program which will print first 30 rounds of Fizz buzz. (Hint: beware of the order of divisibility tests)

# 4. In the previous exercises you have converted inches to centimeters, and vice versa. Create a conversion table with multiple values. For example, the table might look like this:
