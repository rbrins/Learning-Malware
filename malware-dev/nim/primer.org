This is merely an example literate programming with Nim (and may become the norm for me writing programs)

* Create an immutable variable containing your age (in years), print your age in days (1 year = 365 days).

#+BEGIN_SRC nim
const age_years: int = 28
const days_Per_Year: int = 365
var age_Days: int = days_Per_Year * age_Years
echo "I am ", age_Days, " days old"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: I am 10220 days old
